It is done continuously with higher or lower intensity, depending on the season, weather and condition, as well as needs of our trees. The most intense work periods are in spring when pruning and planted are carried out, as well as in the fall when it\'s time for harvest. Here\'s how it looks during the year...",
		cultivarsText: "There are many local varieties of olive trees grown in Croatia today, some of which have still retained their original names, thus reminding on the connection with the ancient Mediterranean civilizations. Orcola is one of the oldest ancient cultivars held to date. Rossignolo, Buga, Carbona, Morasolo, Susino and many others began to spread during the Middle Ages. In addition to many local cultivars, we can find vast number of economically valuable varieties in modern plantations imported mainly from Italy and France.\nThe olive cultivars are classified into two main groups, according to their purpose: oil cultivars and table cultivars. Oil cultivars are characterized by smaller fruit and higher oil content. On the other hand, table cultivars have bigger fruit, with a favorable ratio of flesh and seeds and less oil content.",
		diseasesText: "Olives are affected by many pests and diseases, and some of them can have significant economic consequences.\nThe diseases are mainly divided into three basic groups: fungal, bacterial and viral. Parasites can be divided into two basic groups: parasites in young olive groves and parasites in fruitful olive groves. The most dangerous parasites and diseases of the olives are those who attack the fruits, flowers and leaves of the plant. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the correct approach and a separate program for the protection and control measures. Here is the list of some of the most important pests and diseases present in our olive groves.",

				title: "Peacock Spot",
				subTitle: "The most common worldwide olive disease",
				latinTitle: "Spilocaea oleaginea Cast.",
				description: "Peacock spot disease, also known as olive leaf spot, is a worldwide agricultural problem and it thrives in similar conditions wherever it occurs. It is caused by a fungus, Spilocaea oleaginea. Cultivars vary in their susceptibility, but all are subject to infection. The pathogen also infects fruit and fruit stems, but lesions are observed most often on the upper surface of leaves low in the tree canopy. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the disease may take several years to become serious enough to cause alarm. Olive trees that grow in wetter microclimates and in shadow are especially susceptible to the attack of the disease. Plants may experience defoliation and, in severe cases, twig death. Blooms may also fail, resulting in significant reductions to crop production. The fungus depends on mild to low temperatures and free moisture to germinate, so infections usually occur in the fall and spring. The presence of free moisture on the leaves is crucial for the conidia to germinate.",
				symptoms: "Peacock spot appears on upper surface of leaves as sooty blotches that develop into muddy green to black, circular spots about 2.5 to 12 mm in diameter. There may be a yellow halo around the spot. Such symptoms resemble eyes on the peacock feather. Hence the name of the disease, which is the same in different countries.",
				prevention: "The most common management approach is to spray the foliage with copper compound after the fruit has been harvested in the fall (October, November) and again in the spring (between February and April). According to research, autumn spraying is the most important because of the wet conditions and free moisture in the air. A power sprayer with high pressure is the most effective as it helps coat the entire surface of each leaf, even in the interior of the tree. Copper fungicides are also recommended because they have a good effect on other olive diseases, such as olive knot, Dalmatian disease or patula, and others. Also, proper pruning and felling of trees are critical for minimizing the possibility of infection.",

				latinTitle: "Pseudomonas syringae pv. Savastanoi Smith.",
				description: "Olive knot, caused by a bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi, has affected olive trees since ancient times. Openings are necessary for the penetration of the bacteria, and appear by way of leaf and blossom scars, pruning injuries, bark cracks made by freezing, or wounds that occur during orchard operations. They can appear on twigs, branches, trunks, leaves, or fruit stems. All cultivars are susceptible, and damage can be severe, especially in tree nurseries.",
				symptoms: "Olive knot appears as rough galls or swellings about 1.3 to 5 cm in diameter on the leaves, branches and tree trunks. After a certain period the galls start to fall apart and in their place the bark of branches bursts in the form of 'cancer' or lesions. The galls interfere with the transport of water and sugar, causing defoliation and death of twigs and branches.",
				prevention: "Olive knot is difficult to control. Prevention is the only reliable strategy. First of all, make sure that the parent plants are healthy and in good condition. Applying copper with bactericides to protect leaf scars and other injuries minimizes the spread of the disease, but it must be repeated often in order to protect new wounds as they appear. It is also helpful to carefully prune during the dry season to remove galls on twigs and branches. Infected parts of the plant should be removed and burned. Because the bacteria may be carried on pruning shears, be sure to disinfect them frequently and keep them clean.",

Although the disease is well distributed throughout olive growing regions of the world, it is of minor signifance. It appears in spring or fall, that is, in warm and very rainy weather, which favor the development of fungi.",
				symptoms: "The disease can develop on leaves, shoots, stems and very rarely in fruits. The color changes on the reverse of the infected leaves. At first the color is greenish, then yellowing. The fallen leaves turn brown on the upper side, and on the lower side a gray velvety mycelium coating appears. The fungus causes small brown sunken spots with greenish boundaries on the surface of the infected berries.",
				prevention: "The most common approach is to spray the foliage with copper compounds in the same period when the treatment against the peacock spot is carried out.",

				description: "Sooty mold is a collective term for different Ascomycete fungi that attack all parts of the olive tree (leaves, branches, fruit). The mold benefits from either a sugary exudate produced by the plant or fruit, or if the plant is infested by honeydew-secreting insects or sap suckers. The disease is spread by the wind.",
				symptoms: "The main symptom is a black, powdery coating adhering to plants and their fruit. The disease mostly occurs in neglected olive groves where suppression of harmful insects is not carried out. Sooty mold itself does little if any harm to the plant, but its appearance can greatly reduce the assimilation surface of the leaves and the process of photosynthesis.",
				prevention: "Combating sooty mold can be quite difficult. First of all, it is recommended to use specific insecticides and pesticides against the infestation of scale insects, and prune the tree so as to allow for a good ventilation of the canopy. The simplest form of non-chemical control is to wipe and wash affected plant parts with lukewarm water and soap, insecticidal soap or dish soap (one tablespoon per gallon of water; strong soaps or detergents may damage the plant). The infection is also managed with products based on copper, such as Bordeaux mixture 1-2%, or with the solution of urea of 1.2%, compatible with pesticides.",

				description: "Olive moth is one of the most important olive tree pests in all olive growing regions. The damage can sometimes be substantial, but it is considered that the average loss caused by olive moth is about 20-30% of the yield. The body of the moth is 6-8 mm long, and the wingspan is 13-15 mm. The wings are greyish, usually with several black spots. A black area at the base of the front edge is always present. There are usually three larval generations of the olive moth in the Mediterranean, and each causes damage to a separate part of the olive tree. Larvae of the first generation attack the flowers (April-May), in some cases causing up to 90-95% damage. The second generation feeds on the fruits being formed (June-July). This damage can also be very serious. The third generation feeds on the leaves boring mines.",
				symptoms: "The most common evidence of the presence of the moth are bitten flowers, damage at the junction of the stem and fruit, bitten seeds and winding corridors on the leaves. The falling of the fruits occurs during the months of July, August and September.",
				prevention: "To effectively control the olive moth it is necessary to develop appropriate methods of forecasting, i.e. following the flight of butterfly populations using nutritional baits and pheromone traps. It is generally accepted that when the daily amount of captured butterflies is more than five insects per trap, it is necessary to switch to using insecticides. Insecticides based on dimethoate have very good effect on olive moth. Also, there are other biological-bacteriological insecticides based on antagonistic bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki, which are commonly used for the suppression of the first generation of pests.",

				description: "The olive fruit fly poses a serious threat for all olive growers. It is considered the most damaging pest in all olive growing regions of the world. The adult olive fruit fly is about 5 mm long, reddish brown in color, with large reddish eyes and small antennae. The body is long with clear wings containing dark veins and a small dark spot at the wing tip. The head, thorax, and abdomen are brown with darker markings with several white or yellow patches on each side. Larvae are yellowish-white maggots with a pointed head. The olive fruit fly has three, and sometimes as many as six generations per year, depending on local conditions. The first females can lay eggs in un-harvested fruit from the previous year. Flies emerging later can lay eggs directly into new fruit. Olive fruit susceptibility begins at the time of pit hardening, in July or, earlier depending on climatic conditions. The larvae come out of the egg after 2-3 days and develop in the fruit for the next 2 weeks, and pupae, in the summer, in 8 to 10 days. Adult flies can live from 2 to 6 months depending on the temperature and food availability (honey dew, fruit juices, bird feces, etc.). In the fall most of the last generation larvae leave the fruit and pupate in the soil under the tree for several months. Adults can also overwinter in protected areas, especially those with mild temperatures. Olives left on trees after harvest can produce high populations of flies from late fall to early spring.",
				symptoms: "The presence of flies can be detected by the characteristic small brown stings, maggots, or tunneling in the infected olive berries which in turn change color (into purple), decay and fall off.",
				prevention: "The conventional method of suppression involves spraying the entire tree several times per season in order to prevent the formation of the larvae in the fruit. The most common treatments are carried out by spraying the trees with systemic and contact insecticides (dimethoate, deltamethrin, and phosmet) that are used for protecting against other pests (Olive moth, Olive leaf moth, etc.). When it comes to controlling the olive fly, being vigilant, diligent, and systematic is critical. Keep in mind that the fly is most likely present in your orchard even though you may not see either the fly or the damage without scrupulous attention. There are many environmentally acceptable physical methods and technologies. The most common are the use of visual attractive traps with biocide adhesives, the yellow plates, or the sprawling traps with attractive and effective insecticides. The baits attract adult flies that must feed to prolong life and produce eggs. The adult flies are attracted to the bait, feed on it, and die. The suppression of the first generation of the olive fruit fly is done in early July. The others are done in mid-September and between the beginning and the middle of October.",

				description: "This species is widely distributed in the Mediterranean basin and causes important losses to olive trees, ranging from 30 to 80%. The adult insect is a reddish weevil, about 5 mm in size. Apart from olives, this species can also attack other types of related plants in the Oleaceae family. One generation of the weevil has a two-year cycle, overwintering as a mature larva during the first year, with adults in the soil during the second year. In spring (April to May), adults move from the soil to the canopy of olive trees, consuming young shoots and leaves and also burrowing into young olive fruits to the kernel, causing fruit drop.",
				symptoms: "It is important to monitor the pests during the critical period from the middle of June to the end of August, when female insects deposit eggs drilling the holes of 0.5 mm in diameter in the fruit pulp. The presence of the weevil can be easily observed when waving the branches. Insects then fall to the ground and after a few moments depart back. It is recommended that the suppression be initiated if there are more than 5 insects per tree.",

				latinTitle: "Palpita unionalis Hb.",
				description: "Unlike olive moth, which destroys olive blossoms, olive leaf moth damages young leaves. The greatest damage occurs in young plantations because it affects young plants, destroying the peaks and causing stagnation or inadequate growth of the tree. Young larvae are peal yellow, becoming gradually green. Maximum body length is 18-20 mm. The pupa is brown in color, 12-16 mm in length and 3-4 mm in width. Adults are peal or white and are triangular at resting.",
				symptoms: "Before changing into pupa, the larva attaches a few leaves with silken filaments and becomes pupa while spinning a cocoon. The most common symptoms are glued leaves of young peaks, with floral fringes glued to the leaves. When opening them, a green or brown worm about 1.5 cm long can be found inside, leaving its bed with nervous movements.",
				prevention: "The suppression of olive leaf moth is not easy, because the caterpillar is well protected between the leaves and difficult to reach by insecticide. Removing the infested twigs and shoots is one of the best control methods. To control the pest, agrotechnical, biological and, in the case of heavy infestations of leaves, chemical methods are recommended. Nevertheless, pyrethrin-based insecticides that destroy this pest also destroy other insects that attack olive leaf moth, so they are not recommended. It is advisable to use bioinsecticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis spores, or chemical insecticides based on trichlorfon, deltrametrina and dimethoate.",

It is an insect of modest size (2-2.5 mm), dark in colour and rounded in form. The oval-shaped eggs are placed in special cells dug into the sprigs. In the spring, adult bark beetle leaves its overwintering place. Annually, there are two generations.",
				symptoms: "In the spring, adult bark beetle leaves its overwintering place and starts to dig tunnels in young branches or in the branches of pruning residues in which the eggs are deposited. The most common evidence of its presence are small holes with a diameter of 2-3 mm on the dry twigs, from which bark beetles throw sawdust. The most damage is caused by adults, who with their excavations cause the death of the fruit-bearing branches, resulting in a loss of production (up to 60%). In weaker or younger plants their attack can result in death of the plant.",
				prevention: "One of the well known preventive methods of suppression is hanging bundles of small olive branches to the tree as baits. By the end of April all bundles must be collected and burned. Other effective means of suppression is the destruction of the infested branches and pruning residues, which are suitable for the pests’ development.",

The adults are very dark, even black in color. The body is rather stocky (3-3.5 mm), covered with dark fuzz. The bark beetle has only one generation per year and overwinters as a larva inside the tree. Bark beetles often attack trees that are already weakened by disease, drought, smog, conspecific beetles, or physical damage. Healthy trees may put up defenses by producing resin or latex, which may contain a number of insecticidal and fungicidal compounds that can kill or injure the attacking insects, or simply immobilize and suffocate them with the sticky fluid. The adults appear in spring (usually in May) and attack young olive branches.",
				symptoms: "Usually, affected branches can be identified by the red-brown marks on the bark. Gradually the branches begin to wither from the injection site to the top.",

The caterpillars are yellow with many black dots and grow up to 5-6 cm, feeding for two or three years in the stems and branches before emerging to pupate under the bark.",
				symptoms: "The attack consists of a small hole (2-3 mm in diameter) through which the larva enters the trunk. During this phase its presence can be noticed by the discharge from the hole and the dark color of the bark around the hole. Gradually the branches begin to wither from the injection site to the top.",
				prevention: "The control is not easy for two reasons. The first is the behavior of adults, which are active from May to early fall. Another reason is the difficulty of identifying the larvae when they feed on timber. Accordingly, various agrotechnical and biotechnical measures are applied: pruning and removing infected branches, pheromone traps for sexual interference and mass hunting (about 10 traps per ha), and spraying against other pests (olive moth).",

A hand lens is usually needed to detect the crawlers. Black scale prefers dense, unpruned portions of trees. Open, airy trees rarely support populations of black scale.",
				symptoms: "The detection is fairly easy because young black scales excrete sticky, shiny honeydew on leaves of infested trees. At first, affected trees and leaves glisten and then become sooty and black in appearance as sooty mold fungus grows on the honeydew, reducing photosynthesis and causing the drying and decay of individual branches and trees.",
				prevention: "Biological control and pruning to open up closed canopies are key to managing black scale. Also, it is very important to monitor and detect the presence of honeydew on leaves, and track black scale population levels in olive groves. Chemical treatment include red oil (concentration 3%), various preparations based on azinphos, carbaryl, metidathion, monocrotophos, imidacloprid or buprophezin (growth regulators).

The recommendation to start harvesting is when the fruit skin has changed color to 30% of the area, or when there is approximately the same percentage of coloured fruits on the tree. Most olives today are harvested manually or using different tools which feature large tongs that spin around quickly, removing fruit from the tree without damaging it. Fruit should be submitted to the mill and processed as soon as possible (within 24 hours), otherwise we can keep it stored in a dry, airy and dark room for no longer than 3 days. Transportation of fruit is done in perforated plastic boxes, not in bags. It is especially important to pay attention to the temperature of olive mixture or paste during processing.

		cultivarsText: "Esistono molte varietà autoctone nella nostra zona ed alcune hanno mantenuto il nome originario e con esso il legame con le antiche civiltà mediterranee. Orzola è la varietà più antica arrivata fino ai nostri giorni. Rossignolo, Buga, Carbona, Morasolo, Susino invece, iniziarono a diffondersi nel Medioevo. Oltre a numerose varietà locali, negli oliveti moderni troviamo alcune varietà di alto valore economico, importate principalmente dall\'Italia e dalla Francia.\nIl principale criterio di classificazione delle cultivar di olivo è l\'utilizzo del raccolto: cultivar da olio e cultivar da mensa. Caratterizzano le cultivar da olio la pezzatura piccola dei loro frutti con una buona resa in olio. Le cultivar da mensa con la grande pezzatura del frutto, la resistenza della drupa alle manipolazioni e la loro bassa resa in olio, sono destinate quasi esclusivamente alla trasformazione in olive da tavolo.",
		diseasesText: "L\'olive vengono attacate da un grande numero di malattie e parassiti, alcune delle quali possono causare gravi danni economici.\nLe malattie si dividono in tre gruppi: le malattie fungine, quelle batteriche e quelle virali. I parassiti possono essere divisi in due gruppi: i parassiti degli oliveti giovani, non fruttiferi e i parassiti degli oliveti fruttiferi. I parassiti e le malattie dell\'olivo più pericolosi sono quelli che attaccano i frutti, i fiori e le foglie della pianta. Per questo motivo è importante distinguere gli approcci corretti ed applicare i programmi di protezione e di soppressione adeguati. Qui sono illustrati e descritti alcune tra le più importanti malattie ed i parassiti presenti nei nostri oliveti.",

Si manifesta soprattutto sulle foglie e nella sua forma più acuta ne causa la caduta, chiamata defoliazione. I casi dell'infezione del frutto o dei ramoscelli, molto rari, si riconoscono con la comparsa delle macchioline marroni. La malattia compare due volte l'anno, nell'autunno e nella primavera perché le pioggie stagionali, l'alta umidità e le temperature più basse sono particolarmente favorevoli allo sviluppo dei funghi patogeni. I sintomi si manifestano usualmente nelle parti inferiori della chioma, mentre le parti superiori generalmente non ne vengono affetti.",
				symptoms: "I sintomi della malattia appaiono sul lato superiore delle foglie come tondeggianti macchie di colore verde scuro, grandi all'incirca dieci o dodici millimetri. Successivamente attorno alle macchie si formano giallo-verdi anelli, mentre la parte centrale della macchia si necrotizza diventando marrone scuro. Il loro aspetto ricorda gli „occhi“ delle penne dei pavoni, e da qui il nome della malattia, utilizzato anche in altri paesi.",
				prevention: "La prevenzione della malattia si effetua due volte l'anno, principalmente con fungicidi a base di rame che sono consigliati in quanto efficaci anche contro altre malattie degli ulivi come la rogna, la patula o malattia dalmata, ecc. Possono essere utilizzati anche fungicidi a base di difenconazolo e tebuconazolo con trifloxystrobina. Nel mondo ci sono fungicidi organici a base di zinebio (Zn2+), dodino (C15H33N3O2), mancozebio (C4H8MnN2S4Zn) ed altri. La prima spruzzatura va fatta in autunno, tra la fine di settembre e l'inizio di ottobre, cioé dopo il raccolto. E' la più importante perché le infezioni sono più frequenti in questo periodo. La seconda spruzzatura viene fatta in primavera tra la fine di febbraio e l'inizio di marzo. Un'adeguata potatura e la sfrondatura degli alberi sono fondamentali per ridurre al minimo la possibilità dell'infezione.",

				prevention: "Per combattere efficacemente la tignola dell'olivo è necessario sviluppare adeguati metodi prognostici, cioè monitorare gli spostamenti delle popolazioni di farfalle volanti. A questo scopo si possono utilizzare i contenitori con esche nutritive e le trappole a base di feromoni. E' opinione comune che quando la quantità giornaliera delle farfalle catturate supera i cinque insetti per trappola, sia necessario passare all'utilizzo degli insetticidi.

La mosca femmina perfora la pelle del frutto e vi depone un uovo fecondato. Dopo due giorni la larva fuoriesce dall'uovo e si nutre della polpa del frutto raggiungendo in due settimane il suo massimo livello di sviluppo trasformandosi in crisalide dalla quale, dopo ulteriori dieci giorni fuoriesce l'insetto adulto.

Quelli più utilizzati sono gli insetticidi sistemici e quelli a contatto. È importante la metodicità del trattamento che deve coinvolgere tutti gli arbusti e tutte le parti fruttuose. I metodi fisici e biotecnologici riconosciuti come non nocivi per l'ambiente sono l'utilizzo di attrativi visivi con i biocidi adesivi, le targhe gialle ad esempio, oppure le trappole tentacolari con attrattivi ed efficaci insetticidi. Le mosche adulte vengono attirate nelle trappole con feromoni e a contatto con gli insetticida muoiono.

E’ il punteruolo dell’olivo, uno tra i tanti nomi comuni con il quale è conosciuto. L’adulto è di color rosso mattone appena lucente, tendente al grigio e ha una lunghezza totale di 5-6 mm. A parte gli olivi, attacca anche altre piante della famiglia delle Oleaceae. Una generazione del punteruolo ha un ciclo di due anni. Gli adulti emergono dalle pupe formatesi nel terreno, tra aprile e maggio, e in volo si portano sulla chioma delle piante ospiti per nutrirsi inizialmente a spese dell’epidermide inferiore e del mesofillo delle foglie, praticando così delle tipiche erosioni a chiazza, non lesive dell’epidermide superiore che tuttavia, con il tempo, dissecca e si distacca dal lembo fogliare. Su foglie giovani, l’attività trofica può causare il disseccamento totale o malformazioni. Una volta formatisi i frutti, gli adulti li utilizzano per la propria nutrizione praticandovi delle escavazioni circolari di 0,5 mm di diametro, attorno alle quali si forma poi un caratteristico alone bruno. Su drupe ancora sufficientemente piccole, il rostro del punteruolo può raggiungere la mandorla determinando poi la caduta del frutto.",

				description: "Questo parassita attacchi quasi tutti i tipi di alberi da frutto. Farfalle femmine adulte hanno un'apertura alare di 5-6 cm e maschi 3,5-4 cm. Le ali sono di colore bianco e punteggiato. Tracce sono di colore giallo con molti punti neri e crescono 5-6 cm. Le uova vengono deposte nelle screpolature della corteccia o nelle ferite da innesto, in gruppi numerosi, talvolta fino a qualche centinaio. Una volta fuoriuscite dalle uova, le larve si dirigono alla ricerca di tessuti vegetali teneri, quali apici e germogli. ",
				symptoms: "L'attacco consiste in un piccolo foro del diametro di 2 o 3 mm attraverso cui la larva entra nel tronco. Durante questa fase è possibile accorgersi della sua presenza dalla fuoriuscita di liquido dal forellino di ingresso e dal colore scuro della corteccia attorno al foro dove è stato roso il legno sottostante. Sono presenti anche delle piccole sfere di legno tritato che viene espulso dalla larva. Ramoscelli attaccate vengono aseccate in parti dei fori di cui sopra.",
				prevention: "Il controllo della Zeuzera pyrina non è facile per due motivi. Il primo risiede nel comportamento degli adulti, i quali hanno un periodo di sfarfallamento piuttosto lungo, che si protrae da maggio fino agli inizi dell'autunno. Il secondo risiede nella difficoltà di individuare e raggiungere le larve quando sono nella fase xilofaga. Un efficace mezzo di lotta consiste nella distruzione dei rami infestati e dei residui della potatura, che costituiscono il substrato più idoneo per il suo sviluppo. Fra altri metodi applicabili si annoverano confusione sessuale (disposizione di erogatori di feromone sessuale), trappole chemiotropiche innescate con il feromone sessuale (10 trappole ad ettaro) e lotta chimica con prodotti fosforganici ad azione sistemica, o sulla base di propoxur, chlorpyriphos e piretroidi.",

Sull albero infetto l'assimilazione è limitata, i rami si seccano fino a far seccare l'intera pianta.

Prima di intraprendere un qualsiasi intervento di controllo chimico del parassita è consigliabile ricorrere a degli interventi di natura agronomica. Infatti, diversi fattori colturali influenzano lo sviluppo delle popolazioni dell’insetto (potatura, irrigazione e concimazione). La potatura permette di eliminare i rami fortemente infestati e di arieggiare la chioma, favorendo l’azione dei fattori abiotici in estate (alte temperature), che risultano essere la principale causa di mortalità delle giovani neanidi. Anche una corretta gestione dell’irrigazione, un'equilibrata concimazione ed un’uso ridotto di pesticidi, evitano la proliferazione della cocciniglia.",

Od antičkih sorti koje su se kod nas održale do danas, spominje se Orcola, dok su se kroz srednji vijek širile sorte Rossignolo, Buga, Carbona, Morasolo, Susino i druge. U suvremenim su nasadima zastupljene, osim značajnih domaćih sorti, i mnoge gospodarski vrijedne sorte uvezene uglavnom iz Italije i Francuske.\nOsnovna podjela sorti maslina polazi od njihove namjene, pa se svrstavaju u uljne i stolne sorte. Uljne sorte u svojim plodovima imaju veći sadržaj ulja nego stolne i uglavnom su sitnijeg ploda. Stolne sorte krupnijeg su ploda, s povoljnijim odnosom mesa i koštice i manjim sadržajem ulja.",

				description: "Paunovo oko je najraširenija bolest koje se uvijek javlja u našim maslinicima. Na napad bolesti osobito su podložna stabla maslina koja rastu u vlažnijim mikroklimatima i u sjeni. Uslijed jake zaraze dolazi do opadanja lišća ili defolijacije. Na ostalim organima masline kao npr. plodovima ili grančicama zaraze su vrlo rijetke, a simptomi se uočavaju kao male smeđe pjegice. Zaraze na lišću javljaju se dva puta godišnje, u jesen i proljeće, s dolaskom kišnog razdoblja, kada je velika vlaga i kada su temperature niže, što odgovara razvoju ove patogene gljive. Simptomi se najviše uočavaju na donjim dijelovima krošnje, dok gornji dijelovi krošnje često ostaju zdravi.",
				symptoms: "Simptomi bolesti se uglavnom javljaju na licu listova u vidu okruglastih, tamnozelenih pjega, veličine 10-12 mm. Kasnije se oko pjega formira žuto-zeleni prsten, a središnji dio posmeđi ili nekrotizira. Takvi simptomi podsjećaju na oči po paunovom perju, pa otuda dolazi naziv bolesti, koji se kao takav koristi i u drugim zemljama.",
				prevention: "Ova bolest se u toku godine suzbija dva puta, i to prvenstveno fungicidima na bazi bakra. Bakreni fungicidi također se preporučuju jer imaju dobro djelovanje i na neke druge bolesti masline kao što je rak masline, dalmatinska bolest ili patula i dr. Također dozvolu imaju i fungicidi na bazi difenkonazola i tebukonazola s trifloksistrobinom. U svijetu se također koriste i neki organski fungicidi na bazi cineba, dodina, mankozeba i drugih. Prvo prskanje mora biti u jesen i to krajem rujna i početkom listopada, odnosno nakon berbe, a drugo u proljeće, krajem veljače i početkom ožujka. Prema istraživanjima jesensko prskanje je najvažnije, jer su tada najčešće zaraze. Od preventivnih mjera zaštite važno je provoditi pravilnu rezidbu i prozračivanje krošnje stabala, da bi se smanjili uvjeti za razvoj.",
